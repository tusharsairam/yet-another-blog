# Summary
I'm currently working as a GNC engineer, developing ADCS components for LEO satellites. My interdisciplinary background spans control systems and instruments all the way to autonomous robot algorithms and aerospace engineering. I enjoy solving hard problems that deliver high-impact benefits to humankind.

# Academic Projects
- Implementation of a UAV Swarm coordination simulator: Constructed safe and dynamically feasible trajectories
of a swarm of 64+ UAVs in a random 3D obstacle forest, using convex hull optimization in ROS, C++ and
MATLAB.
- Randomized Ensemble Double-Q Learning: Investigated and implemented an ensemble Q-learning algorithm that
demonstrates high sample efficiency and greater simplicity than model-based RL Algorithms on PyTorch
- Deep Learning model to protect vehicles from crashing into animals: Performed big data processing of satellite-
derived image and road datasets and constructed a Neural Network architecture trained on the dataset to predict potential
hazards of animal collision in remote forest-adjacent roadways.
- Neural Network-based Object Localisation with Discriminators for Specialised Applications: Implemented
a combination of a bounding box regressor and a classifier trained from Kaggle Datasets to beat the YOLO detection
algorithm while attempting to classify aircraft models. Our model occupied almost 70% less storage space and was
2-3x faster.
- Autonomous Robot Manipulation (Introduction to Robotics): Programmed a TIAGo robot on ROS (Python) to
perform mobile manipulation tasks such as pick-place and obstacle avoidance.

# Personal Projects
- **Path-Planning Simulator:** Built a simple graphical simulator in Python that demonstrated the A\*, RRT, and Dijkstra’s
algorithm. Currently working on implementing Probabilistic Road Maps, Potential Fields, and D* algorithms to expand
the simulator’s capabilities.
- **Genetic Algorithm Simulator:** Wrote a simulator for genetic algorithms using the Dear PyGui framework in
Python. The goal is to learn and experiment with the GA hyperparameters and provide a useful learning resource to
gain a visual understanding of the algorithm’s workings.
