**Super Metroid** is a console game released by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertaiment System (SNES) released in 1994. I remember first playing it on my desktop PC back when I was in school (I think it was around 2015), using the [ZSNES emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZSNES). Ah, good times. My experience in India says the presence of consoles like the NES etc., aren't that popular. Most people didn't even know of games like this. Official releases in India was heavily limited or non-existent, and most of us Indians grew up on bootleg NES titles packaged into [TV Game consoles like this](https://www.amazon.in/Mitashi-GameIn-Infrazone-Gaming-Console/dp/B007WSOAV8). The first time I remember coming across the Metroid series of games was from an old internet Flash game called [Super Mario Bros. Crossover](https://archive.org/details/super-mario-crossover-flash-game.). I was a wee schoolkid at that time, around 7th grade, when I came across this on Newgrounds. That game was about controlling various video game characters inside the NES Mario Bros levels. I found it creative at that time, and highly addictive too. One of the characters in the game was Samus Aran, the protagonist of the Metroid games. I didn't know who she was back then, all I saw was "fancy robot soldier with a gun for a hand". Megaman but more... human-shaped. I loved playing as Samus. The controls felt fluid, the Metroid powerups (taken from the NES game) were simple but uniquely powerful. The soundtrack was also atmospheric, something I didn't expect from video games of that time. Eventually, my interests went from there to *Super Metroid*

## Story
*Super Metroid* follows the events of Metroid II: The Return of Samus. Anybody who has played the game might recall the famous opening line of the game, accompanied by a chorus-y voice:

> The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.

Metroids are the eponymous creatures of the game, and they are green jellyfish-like aliens with "teeth" and red organs and blood vessels inside the transparent green outer skin that resembled raspberries. They make high-pitched cries and they can drain the life-force out of most living organisms they can latch on. While Samus, a bounty hunter, was busy exterminating the Metroids on the planet SR388, she encountered an egg. The egg hatched to reveal a baby Metroid that immediately noticed Samus and assumed her to be her mother and began circling around her. Unable to kill the creature, Samus returned the Metroid baby to a group of scientists in the Ceres Space Colony to perform research and experiments for the greater good. Unfortunately, soon after, an alien attacked the colony, killing all scientists and grabbing the Metroid Capsule. Samus tries to stop it but in vain, as it flies away and the station begins its self-destruct sequence. Luckily enough, Samus escapes and lands in Zebes, home of the ancient civilization of birdmen, the Chozo, now home to the Space Pirates, the bad boys of the game. The actual game begins here, where Samus should explore the planet's corners, wipe out the space pirate race and recover the Metroid capsule before things go unfathomably wrong.

The story is not extensively rich, in my opinion. It reminds me of John Carmack's famous quote on why Doom doesn't have a storyline. Players finding *Super Metroid* as their first game in the Metroid series might lose a lot of context. Unlike the classic Megaman games, where each game still feels like it has an independent storyline (although it's not as separate as you might think), the Metroid games are all strongly inter-connected. *Super Metroid* focus more on the atmosphere and gameplay than the storyline, and there's not much for me to talk about without putting other games into context, which is beyond the scope of this essay. 

## Gameplay
The gameplay is hands down, one of the best in all of gaming history. No words can do justice towards the sheer finesse and richness of the experience *Super Metroid* offers. I would strongly recommend playing it!

**The game doesn't present a tutorial or hold your hands at any stage of the game**. When starting out, it's natural to feel lost on what to do. Even the status bar on the top doesn't carry much information -- the emptiness however does indicate that over time, Samus can gain more abilities that would eventually complete the bar. Moreover, during the early stages of the game, you will find that you're heavily restricted on where to go. For instance, the fight with Ridley is a guaranteed loss. No matter how much you attack him, Ridley will escape. He's too powerful at this point, and you have practically nothing except a pea shooter. That's the game's way of telling you that you're a neophyte but you'll gradually become strong enough to wipe the floor with him later down the line. Very similar formula to Megaman X1, where X is initially too weak to even dent Vile until Zero comes to rescue him. Ultimately, you become strong enough to have a serious fight with Vile and gain the upper hand. Pretty beautiful method of storytelling through gameplay.

One interesting and empowering concept of gameplay is the **incremental nature** of powerups. Missile Tanks stack up to your existing payload. So do Super Missiles and Power Bombs. While most of them are available as rewards for the curious and exploratory player, some are also available without much effort, meaning that even an absolute beginner will 100% find himself playing around with these gadgets. Experienced and curious players will be rewarded with a larger payload capacity, which makes the game all the more fun to play. The more missiles and bombs you acquire, the more powerful you become. It's *Super Metroid*'s way of reaffirming the common saying -- "We rise to great heights by a winding staircase of small steps"

Each powerup adds a powerful ability to Samus, and the game usually forces you to experience areas where those powerups shine, without them. This teaches the player the importance of that powerup and how it affects difficulty and progression. A great example is the long corridor before the Speed Booster room in Norfair. Prior to acquiring it, you're just running across the sloping corridor, while the crumbling blocks disappear below you. Easy enough. How are you going to go back up though? After grabbing the Speed Booster, suddenly, lava starts rising up at an astonishing speed. The game puts you in a state of panic and forces you to activate the booster and run at breakneck speeds to escape the corridor before the lava consumes you. The powerups stack as always, making you ridiculously overpowered towards the end of the game.

The enemies are generally annoying to kill. It's less the difficulty in killing them but more of your degree of agility and aim. This really makes you appreciate the power of the many beam weapons of the game, and the various armor upgrades that make you realize how tough those enemies were prior to acquiring them. The bosses are all pretty unique in the way they attack you and vice-versa. Kraid's a gargantuan beast forcing you to climb up, jump, and then shoot him. Phantoon forces you to wait and attack at precise timings all while in a tiny room flooded with blue bolts. Draygon's too fast and a massive PITA until you realize you're underwater and you have the electric grappling beam, which makes quick work of him. Ridley's weakness is his entire body and your best strategy is packing every single missile and super missile into him every single second, encouraging raw button-mashing might.

The game presents 5 unique beam weapons in addition to your Power Beam (which I shamelessly equate to Megaman's pea shooter blaster). Each beam powerup adds unique abilities to your gun and makes you stronger. What's cooler is that **they can be stacked together to compound their effects**! 
- **Charge Beam** (*Brinstar*) - Allows Samus to *charge her Power Beam to launch a more powerful shot* capable of frying bigger enemies and even hurting bosses. Interestingly, this is an optional upgrade! It's hidden but the clues are there in plain sight. However, you can skip the Charge Beam and keep going -- missiles and supers will fill in, and they're much faster anyways. However, the real charm of the charge beam according to me is the ability to kill most small enemies while somersaulting and charging your weapon. I've used this feature more than the actual charged shot many times! Another fancy but useless effect it provides is the ability to lay 5 bouncing bombs when you morph into a ball while charging. I think the game wanted players to experiment with Samus' actions while charging to discover this neat tricks.
- **Ice Beam** (*Norfair*) - Samus' signature beam weapon, and all Metroid fans would immediately remember this. This adds a blue hue, sparkly beam trails, and a *freezing effect* to her shots. Personally, the sound effect of firing the ice beam was pleasing to hear. The ice beam is the most utilitarian beam powerup thanks to being able to freeze enemies (really drives home the "Daddy Chill" meme) and/or use the frozen monsters as stepping stones. Offense-wise, I hate it. When you could kill an enemy with one shot, the ice beam requires two -- one to freeze and one to kill. 
- **Wave Beam** (*Norfair*) - This is *Super Metroid*'s answer to quantum tunnelling. The wave beam not only jacks up the strength of your gun but also turns every shot into a purple blast that travels in a sinusoidal fashion. How's this useful, you may ask? One, all wave beam shots can *phase through walls* so you can blast enemies while taking cover behind walls, and two, you can open shutters with buttons placed behind the shutters themselves. You can also kill short enemies due to the reach of the wave beam but I personally don't rely on that. I'd rather use the Spazer beam or jump, aim down, and attack.
- **Spazer Beam** (*Brinstar*) - One of the two "pure offense" beams of the game. The Spazer Beam allows Samus to fire three yellow bolts instead of one shot. This means *increased damage, and wider coverage*. Funnily enough, the three bolts are not independent. Even if only one bolt hits the enemy, all three beams cancel and the enemy takes full damage. Quite OP, so to speak. 
- **Plasma Beam** (*Maridia*) - Every Metroid player's wet dream and the most powerful beam weapon. You get the Plasma beam far later in the game, which means for about 70% of the game, you will keep seeing the blank entry on the 5th slot in the Beams menu and the suspense keeps building until you finally get your hands on it. Right before the Plasma Beam room, you're greeted by a pile of slimy critters. Without the Plasma, you'll find yourself firing several shots to clear them out. However, with the Plasma, you can kill all of them in 1-2 shots (2 shots if you also equipped Ice). That's all thanks to the beam's *enemy-piercing* function, and you'll find that the rest of the game becomes pretty easy with this baby equipped

> **Note:** The Spazer and Plasma beams are incompatible. This is because of in-game memory limitations and how status flags work in-game. I'm not aware of why they work the way they do, but my understanding has been that if both the Spazer and Plasma are somehow equipped together (which you can absolutely do with precise timing and unlock some crazy effects like the [Murder Beam, Chainsaw Beam, and Spacetime Beam](https://wiki.speedga.me/Weapon_Techniques#Glitched_Beams)), they can unset the flag that determines whether the opening cutscene was played. Yeah, that's classic memory corruption right there, and if done with pixel-perfect execution with some moves, you can restart the game **with your current arsenal**! Talk about New Game+

## Atmosphere and Music
Honestly one of the best elements of the game. All-round creepy and ominous tones. You have different environments throughout the game, ranging from dense jungle-like areas teeming with wildlife, all the way to superheated underground caves and artificial metallic corridors. The game markets the feeling of being alone deep inside the crevices of a large planet, the dark ambient backgrounds merely amplifying the feeling. Almost every zone felt like a personal favourite except for the Wrecked Ship because it was small and largely underwhelming. One of my favourite moments in the game is the Golden Statue room, depicting all the four space pirate bosses. Initially, the cave with the statue has no other effect other than pure aesthetics until you come back later to see that it actually responds in proportion to your progress in beating the 4 big bosses. It shows that the gateway to the final stage of the game is fiercely guarded by the four imposing monsters. They're not even directly guarding the entrance to Tourian. Instead, they're scattered in different zones and the statue is telepathically connected to their existence. Oh, and the music? Absolute gems. They multiply the dark aura of the game, and they beautifully complement their accompanying areas too. Norfair's music feels like magma bubbling inside a dark cave, Maridia's music sells the feeling of being a tiny baby drowning in the Pacific Ocean, while Brinstar's upbeat music reminds you of the thriving flora and fauna in the region. 

Overall, one of the greatest games of all time according to me. In fact, I strongly believe *Super Metroid* influenced the speedrunning culture and spawned off an entire subgenre of gaming called **Metroidvania**, which focuses on non-linearity, exploration, and interconnectivity that the Metroid and Castlevania games influenced. Plenty of ROM hacks of Super Metroid also have been coming up that alter the gameplay experience, expand the storyline, and make niche tricks mainstream ([Hyper Metroid](https://metroidconstruction.com/hack.php?id=294), [Super Metroid: Subversion](https://metroidconstruction.com/hack.php?id=716), and [Super Metroid: X-Fusion](https://metroidconstruction.com/hack.php?id=837), just to name a few of many)
