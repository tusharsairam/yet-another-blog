During my spare time, you can find me dabbling in many hobbies of mine. I believe hobbies are where we showcase our personal best work, our creative expressions, and are where we can be our true selves without being affected by external pressing factors. After all, you have free rein over your own pastime activities.

## Drawing (Pencil Shading/monochrome art on paper)
I enjoy drawing pencil-shaded sketches from time to time. My genres are biomechanical art and science-fiction art. Occasionally, I dabble with pixel art using Aseprite. My inspirations are H.R.Giger, Zdzisław Beksiński, Salvador Dali, and Mariusz Lewandowski.

## Reading Books
Currently reading *Three Body Problem* by Cixin Liu and *Star Wars: Darth Plagueis* by James Luceno. I enjoy reading both science fiction and non-fiction books. 

## Building Classic Doom levels
1993 Doom's still famous for its moddability and there are many communities of fans working on publishing custom levels for Doom. I have contributed many maps during the Pineapple Under The Sea speedmapping events. I have contributed speedmaps to the following community-made map compilations:
* [Imperfect Hatred](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/imphate-v4) - MAP06 "Emerald Dynamo"
* [Clandestine Castle Crashing 2](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/thread/134337) - MAP05 "The Temple of the Blood Knight"
* [Quick and Dirty](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/puss30_qnd) - MAP05 "Spider Plasmonics"

I have contributed as a playtester for the following mapsets:
* [Boss Battle Bonanza](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/a-c/bbb-v6)
* [12 Days of Doom-mas](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/xmas/12days-v4)
* [Clandestine Castle Crashing](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/puss5-ccc)

Some other events I was involved in:
* I was a member of the winning team in [Hot Potato](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/119076-hot-potato-team-mapping-event-boom-leage-wad-out-now/) - A speedmapping competition between two teams mapping in the older Boom and more modern UDMF format respectively. My team was the Boom-format mapping league
* I was part of the judging panel for [Mapping Off](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134491-live-charity-stream-myolden-vs-bluepineapple72-mapping-off-live-on-television/), a speedmapping competition hosted as a charity event. All donations proceeded to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The recording of the competition livestream is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcNCPuaTLU8)

### Tools I use for building mapsets
* [Ultimate Doom Builder](https://ultimatedoombuilder.github.io/) - The best editor out there currently. Last I used it, it did support Linux-based systems but pretty much all of my maps were built in Windows. There's a lot of flexibility and a host of options to select from, and the mapping experience is fairly simple, even for beginners.
* [SLADE3](https://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=about) - This is primarily a resource manager. Doom WADs are basically compressed archives containing the assets of the game (music, graphics, sprites, map locations, map data etc.). SLADE3 allows you to insert, delete, and modify these contents, enabling you to develop levels with your own music, graphic assets, and more. SLADE3 also has an in-built map editor although that's limited in features and is harder to use personally.
